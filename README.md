# PSQL-Express-React-Node-GraphQL-Apollo

This is a full stack project that uses the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node) stack, along with GraphQL and Apollo. It is a powerful and flexible combination of technologies that allows you to build robust web applications that can handle complex data models and API integrations.

The front end is located at https://github.com/andrewcbuensalida/restaurant-menu-react.git
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Go to https://main.d270tnz1kj6wbf.amplifyapp.com/

OR

To run it locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   `git clone https://github.com/andrewcbuensalida/PSQL-Express-React-Node-GraphQL-Apollo.git`

2. Install the project dependencies:
   `npm ci`

3. Create a postgres database.

4. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project directory and set the environment variables needed for the project. These are:
   `DATABASE`
   `DATABASE_USER`
   `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
   `SECRET`

5. Start the development server:
   `npm run start`

This will start the server and the client-side React app in development mode.

The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and uses a PostgreSQL database to store data. The GraphQL API is implemented using Apollo Server, which provides a flexible and easy-to-use framework for creating GraphQL APIs. The frontend is built with React, and uses Apollo Client to interact with the GraphQL API.

This project serves as a template for building full stack web applications using the PERN stack, along with GraphQL and Apollo.

Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own web applications, or to learn more about how to build full stack applications with the PERN stack and GraphQL/Apollo.
